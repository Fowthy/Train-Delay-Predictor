    "    <li>The dataset is not balanced. There are much more train departures without delay rather than departures with delay. This means the algorithm may not give accurate results. With oversampling the data, weird train journeys are created, which are practically impossible, therefore it is not a good option. Downsampling the data will result in much less data to work with, which also results to lower accuracy score. </li>\n",
