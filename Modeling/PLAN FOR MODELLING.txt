Predict Delay duration and predict if delay

Rush hour - Time groups

Correlation matrix


Scatter plots for regression for delay duration - Time series probably better
Classification for delay probability - delay duration 0 (No delay) or delay duration > 0 (Delay)
	Clustering - Agglomerative - Unsupervized
	Nearest neighbor - Supervised
	Random Forest - Many Trees - Supervised
	Decision Tree - Supervised
	Neural Network - seems more iffy
Time series - ARIMA MODEL
Gridsearching - for hyperparameters of all models
